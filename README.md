# Musk Interference Model (MIM)

## Overview

The **Musk Interference Model (MIM)** is a web-based prototype that explores the intersection of computational fact-checking, platform discourse, and the performative power of high-profile social media actors. Using Twitterâ€™s API and xAIâ€™s Grok language model, the tool fetches recent tweets from Elon Musk, filters relevant messages, and subjects them to a structured verification routine. The result is a machine-assisted evaluation of the truth value, reasoning, and source attribution of individual tweets in near real time.

## Motivation

Elon Musk wields disproportionate influence in public discourseâ€”not only as a tech entrepreneur, but as the owner of a platform that shapes global attention. Under the banner of "free speech," he often spreads questionable claims and unverified information. These messages are not fringe content; they are highly visible, often widely accepted, and have real-world effects.

This prototype was created to expose the irony of Musk's information dominance: by using his own advanced language modelâ€”xAI's Grokâ€”to check the factual integrity of his statements on his own platform. In doing so, MIM reflects on the recursive loop of influence, truth, and technological power. It is a small, focused intervention, rooted in a belief that platforms must not be treated as neutral spaces when they actively shape the boundaries of public understanding.

## How it works

1. The application uses the Twitter API to retrieve the most recent tweets by Elon Musk.
2. A lightweight filtering algorithm removes retweets, short links, and non-substantive content.
3. Each tweet is submitted to Grok (via xAIâ€™s API), using a custom system prompt requesting structured JSON output including:
    - `conclusion`: true / false / uncertain
    - `reason`: explanation for the assessment
    - `sources`: optional external or factual links
4. The result is visualized in the Streamlit frontend with contextual metadata, highlighting uncertainty and machine limitations.

## Disclaimer

This prototype is an artistic and exploratory tool. It is not a fact-checking authority, nor is it affiliated with Twitter, xAI, or Elon Musk. All evaluations are generated via large language models and should be treated as speculative insightsâ€”not verified truth.
